<h1>MMT/Hectospec: data reduction and common problems
</h1>
<p>

<h4>Benjamin Weiner, MMT Observatory</h4>
<p>

The <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/mmti/hectospec.html">Hectospec fiber spectrograph</a> on the MMT telescope obtains 300
fiber spectra at a time over a 1 degree field of view.  This page is
intended to compile some notes on data reduction and issues that
occasionally cause problems in reduction.
<p>

<h3>How to run HSRED</h3>

See the  <a href="http://www.mmto.org/hsred-reduction-pipeline/"> HSRED page </a> for
how to run HSRED v2 using a wrapper to run all the reduction steps. I
also strongly recommend reading the <a
href="http://mmto.org/~rcool/hsred/hsred_reductions.html">older HSRED
instructions</a>. These tell you what the individual steps are doing.

<p>

<h3>Common problems</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Fits files that don't belong
  <li> Mix of 270 and 600-line grating data
  <li> Missing skyflats
  <li> No standard stars on config?
  <li> Restarting a reduction halfway through
  <li> Detecting completed but problematic data
</ul>
<p>

<h4>Fits files that don't belong</h4>

HSRED will usually attempt to reduce all the *.fits files in your
directory. If there are fits files that it should not touch, it will
run into problems. Generally, every *.fits data file should have an
accompanying *_map file, a text file that describes the fiber
assignments. If there is no map file, an error will occur in
HS_MAPTOPLUG.
<p>

<ul>Actions:
<li>Move all skycam fits files to a subdirectory. See the
  prune_skycam_600.sh file linked below.
  <li>Move all extraneous files away. In particular, if you have any
  "ring250*.fits" files, remove those.
  <li>You should usually have only bias, comp, dark, domeflat, sflat,
  and science images. The science images will have the name of your
  configuration. (Possibly also images of other fields like a
  standard? but typically just your data.)
</ul>
<p>

<h4>Mix of 270 and 600-line grating data</h4>

Hectospec has two gratings, 270-line and 600-line. The 270 is more
commonly used. If your directory has a mix of 270 and 600 data, the
reduction will run and may complete, but the data will look
terrible. The most common issue is that there are some 600-line comps
(arc lamps) or flats mixed in with your comps and flats.
<p>

<ul>Action:
  <li>Run this script: <tt>sh prune_skycam_600.sh</tt> linked here: <a
  href="prune_skycam_600.sh">prune_skycam_600.sh</a> in your data
  directory. This will find all *skycam.fits files and move them to a
  tmp_skycam subdirectory, and look in the image headers to find any
  files with DISPERSE = 600_gpm and move those to a tmp_600grating
  directory. It uses pyraf to list the image headers to a file.
</ul>

If you don't have pyraf, you can use anything that looks at the fits
header of extension 1 or 2 for the DISPERSE keyword to find the files
with 600_gpm. If you are reducing 600-line data and need to get rid of
the 270-line files, just change all the 600 references to 270.
<p>

Note that if there are data with multiple wavelength settings (only
likely with the 600-line grating), you also need to sort those into
one wavelength setting per reduction directory.
<p>

<h4>Missing skyflats</h4>

If there are no skyflats, HSRED will balk and issue an error partway
through the reduction.  Sometimes there may not be any skyflats named
sflat.*.fits in your data directory, if for example the weather was
bad at sunset. 
<p>

<ul>Action:
  <li>Borrow skyflats from another night within the same Hectospec
  run. Either copy the sflat.*.fits files into your directory, or
  if you have an already reduced directory with sky flats, you can
  just copy the list of files: e.g.
  <pre>
  mkdir 2016.1001/lists
  cp 2016.1005/lists/sflat.list 2016.1001/lists/
  </pre>
  If you only have one night of data and there are no skyflats
  included, then 
  contact the TDC (Telescope Data Center) at SAO, from which you
  normally download your data, and they should be
  able to give you access to some flats.
</ul>

<p>

<h4>No standard stars on config</h4>

If you try to reduce a configuration with the /uberextract option to get flux
calibration, and you don't have any standard stars on the config,
HSRED will complain. If you did put F stars on the config, you need to
add them and their magnitudes to HSRED's list of standard stars in
$HSRED_DIR/etc/standardstars.dat, described at the <a
href="http://mmto.org/~rcool/hsred/hsred_reductions.html">older HSRED
instructions</a>.

<ul>Action:
  <li>Add the standard stars to standardstars.dat and rerun. If you
  didn't have any F stars, don't use /uberextract. Next time, select
  some standard stars, e.g. from SDSS use the
  SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC_STANDARD flag and some magnitude criteria (about
  17th mag?).
</ul>
  <p>

<h4> Restarting a reduction halfway through</h4>

I find that if the pipeline crashes for some reason, you fix the
problem, and try to run it again without making changes, the end data
are often garbled - this may include bad sky subtractions, or a SNR vs
magnitude plot with a lot of scatter.  One issue is that HSRED detects
whether files have been processed and doesn't redo them, e.g. if
you've run HS_CALIBPROC and made all of the files in the calibration
subdirectory, running HS_CALIBPROC again will not reprocess them. To
avoid this, start 
over from the beginning with a new rerun number. Your first run will
probably be number 0000. You can start over by giving the optional
command <tt>rerun='0100'</tt> (or 0200, 0300, etc) to commands such as HS_PIPELINE_WRAP,
HS_CALIBPROC, HS_EXTRACT, HS_REDUCE1D.
<p>


<h4> Detecting completed but problematic data </h4>

One tool for checking whether your data are sensible is to make a SNR
vs magnitude plot.  You can do this by running HS_SNR on the spHect
output file.  In IDL, run commands like these:
<p>

<pre>
fname = 'reduction/0000/spHect-2016.1001_1.fits'
lam = mrdfits(fname,0)
object =  mrdfits(fname,1)
plugmap = mrdfits(fname,5)
hs_snr, lam, object, plugmap, snr=snr
</pre>
<p>

This should pop up a plot with continuum SNR measured from the spectra vs.
magnitudes from your input catalog.  If your magnitudes are good,
there should be a decent correlation with modest scatter. For galaxies
with SDSS photometry, I typically see a number like SNR ~ 2-3 at r=21
in about 1-2 hours of Hectospec exposure. If there are
a few outliers, it may indicate problems with some of your targets -
for example, low surface brightness objects will be low SNR outliers
for their magnitude.  If it's a total scatterplot with no correlation,
then something may have gone wrong in the reduction. This has happened
to me a couple of times with the mixed 270 and 600-line files, or with
a reduction that crashed halfway through and was restarted without a
new rerun.
<p>

<h4>Other problems?</h4>

If you have a Hectospec data reduction issue that isn't covered here,
please contact me at bjw@mmto.org.  If you have suggestions to add to
this page, contributions are welcome!
