<h1>BinoMask: Binospec slitmask design software</h1>
<p>

Multislit masks for the <a href="binospec_info.html">Binospec
spectrograph</a> at the <a href="http://www.mmto.org/">MMT
telescope</a> will be designed by the proposers using BinoMask, a web
based package written by Sean Moran at CfA.
<p>

This page has a tutorial / walkthrough on using BinoMask.  For
now this is a walkthrough of a slitmask design, notes written by Ben
Weiner, with screenshots of the process. We are updating this page as needed
and will add a video walkthrough in mid-2018.
To access BinoMask, go to  <a
href="http://scheduler.mmto.arizona.edu/BinoMask/">scheduler.mmto.arizona.edu/BinoMask/</a>
.  Note that you will need to be logged into your MMTO catalog submission account to 
actually submit a mask design.
<p>

<h3>Before you begin mask design</h3>
<p>

You will need to have:
<ul>
<li> Your mask center coordinates (RA, Dec; or object name if NED/SIMBAD can resolve it).
<li> Any constraints on PA, observing date, slit sizes, and other parameters.
<li> A catalog of targets, ideally on the GAIA or GSC2 astrometric system. See below under "Target List" for the file format.
<li> If your catalog is not on GAIA/GSC2 then you will need to provide a separate catalog of guide stars.
</ul>
<p>

The BinoMask software is web based, so you need an Internet connection and a modern browser,
but don't have to download/install anything.
<p>

<p>
  

<h3> 1. Log in and launch BinoMask </h3>
<p>

When you get Binospec time, the MMT/Binospec queue will send you a link
to sign in and administer your program. Or you can go to <a
href="http://scheduler.mmto.arizona.edu/">http://scheduler.mmto.arizona.edu/</a>
and log in. Then click through: Queue Observing Form &gt; Access Catalog
Editor &gt; New Target.  This will open a "wizard" to help you 
specify the type of observation. Try clicking Mask &gt; Create New
Mask &gt; Launch BinoMask.  (If it gives you a warning about leaving
the page without saving data, click ok to leave the page.)
This will start the BinoMask design software running on
scheduler.mmto.arizona.edu.  (If you have difficulty here, see the
"Troubleshooting" section at bottom of the page.)
<p>

The BinoMask page has a header saying "BinoMask  MMT Observatory   [observer name]",
a list of actions in the left column, and a main sky image window in lower right.
If you get a JS9 error message and/or the sky window is blank, try clicking the 
"BinoMask" at upper left to start it.  Scrolling down in the sky window will 
show the assigned target table, which at first is empty.
<p>

<h3>2. Mask Configuration</h3><p>

To begin designing a mask, click Mask Configuration at top of the left column.
A data entry window will pop out to the right. 
Enter a mask name; then enter RA/Dec, or try lookup by name (likely to work on names
resolvable by NED/SIMBAD, e.g. NGC galaxies), observation date,
grating and central wavelength, and click "Update Display."
The image window should update to show your field. Note you may need to scroll up/down
to see everything in the Mask Configuration pop-out. To close it click the X in 
upper right corner.
<p>

<img src="binomask_maskconfig.png">
The tab for setting up your mask configuration: name, coordinates, PA, etc.
<p>


Overlaid on the sky image, there is a red oval at the center of the Bino field. You can 
click and drag it to move the Binospec pointing center. Clicking the red oval will show a
red "handle" point - dragging this will rotate the Binospec pointing.  Large green boxes 
show the Binospec fields of view, small yellow boxes show the alignment star regions, 
and a large blue box to the side shows the guider/WFS patrol region.
If you drag the field toward the edge and want to refresh the background image,
go to the Mask Configuration tab and click Update Display to recenter
on the current mask center.
<p>

<img src="binomask_fieldview.png">
With the Mask Configuration tab closed, you can see the Binospec field
of view on the sky, and click the red oval at center to move and
rotate the field. The position and PA in the Mask Configuration tab
will update to reflect your changes.
<p>

The Mask Configuration tab is also where you set slit width and
length. At present, these are global values. As an aid, the MMT web site
states that the median seeing is in the range of 0.77" - 0.85" based
on data from 2003 to the present. 1 arcsecond wide slits are a good
starting point, and 6 arcseconds is a good minimum length to ensure
sky subtraction.
<p>


<h3>3. Reference (background) Image</h3><p>

Under the "Reference Image" heading in the left column, there are tools for: 
uploading a local image to use as backdrop; refreshing the mask overlay of the
Bino field; and show/hide control buttons in the image window.  The
image control buttons are DS9-ish
file, view, zoom, scale, color, regions, WCS, analysis, help.  You
can, for example, zoom out if your catalog contains objects over a
larger area than the default view.  If you're happy with the default, you don't need
to change anything in this tab.
<p>

<h3>4. Loading a Target List</h3><p>

Clicking "Target List" on the left pops out a window to upload a list of targets.
The first line should be a header with column names selected from (lowercase only):
<pre>name,ra,dec,magnitude,priority,pm-ra,pm-dec,epoch,type </pre>
Only ra and dec are required, but name, magnitude, priority are recommended.
Priorities are 1-highest, 2-next, ....  You then choose comma or tab delimited for the
table.  The RA, Dec can be in either HMS or decimal degrees,
i.e. (1) hh:mm:ss, dd:mm:ss ; or (2) ddd.dddd,  dd.dddd . Type should
be 1 (or “target”), 2 (“sky”) or 3 (“standard”). You can use types 2
and 3 to designate slits as blank sky, or standard stars (TBD: is this
used in the reduction process?) The targets
will be plotted as red points.  Once your target list is loaded, you
can scroll down in the tab to see it under the heading "Current Target List."
<p>

Note that the target table must be comma or
tab delimited, and currently must not include any extra whitespace in
the header line - so
'name,ra,dec,mag' works, but 'name, ra, dec, mag' won't.  We will fix
this to ignore extra whitespace in the near future.  (I think that
whitespace in the catalog lines is ok, just not in the header line.)
<p>

Object priorities can be 1-most important, 2-next most, and so on. The
mask designer will try to optimize the sum of N_rank * 10^-rank, so a
priority 1 object counts 10 times as much as a priority 2 object, and
so on. Using all-integer priorities will work; using all-float
priorities may work (to be tested); and mixing integers and floats in
the priority column currently will cause an error during slit
placement.
<p>

<h4>Target List Best Practices</h4>

<ul>
<li>Objects need to be on a common astrometric frame, and this frame needs to be 
either compatible with Gaia (SDSS is close enough), or you need to supply a catalog 
of guide stars on this frame (see below).
<li>Objects should span a limited range of magnitudes, otherwise bright targets will 
bleed into fainter targets on adjacent slits, and possibly even saturate.
<li>Objects should have a bright magnitude limit - exact value depends on exposure length,
but g or r mag of 15-16 is probably a good starting point.
<li> (To be updated based on further experience with data processing.)
</ul>
<p>

<h4>Very Important! Catalog reference frame</h4>

If your target catalog is in the GAIA reference frame (or optionally GSC2), then BinoMask
can find suitable guide and WFS stars for you. If not, you must create a second
catalog with such stars on the same coordinate system as your targets,
extending to at least 0.4 degree in radius from the center of your
target field. For guide stars, please select a magnitude range of
r=14-18; for WFS stars, magnitude r=11-14.  This is very important
because if you don't get the catalog reference frame right, the mask
alignment using the guide stars will not get the slits onto your targets.
<p>

This star catalog must include
the magnitude column or guide selection will fail. (If absolutely
necessary, you can fake this by setting all WFS stars to mag=13 and
all guide stars to mag=15, but you should have the magnitudes that you
used to select the stars anyway.) You'll load this catalog in the next step.
<p>

TODO: we will find some resources for transforming catalogs from
common reference frames to the GAIA frame and provide links here.
For the moment, one way to address this is to take stars from your catalog and 
cross-match them to the GAIA catalog. The CDS has a <a href="http://cdsxmatch.u-strasbg.fr/xmatch">
table cross matching web service</a> (may be slow to render) and 
the University of Heidelberg's <a href="http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/">GAIA DR1
page</a> gives an example of how to do a 
<a href="http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/help.html#tapUpload">GAIA-to-user table crossmatch</a>
with a client such as TOPCAT.

<p>

A forthcoming feature will be to import a catalog broadcast over SAMP from e.g. TOPCAT, with mostly
similar format requirements, but this is not yet working with https.
<p>

<h3>5. Selecting/Providing a Guide Star catalog</h3><p>

The "Guide Box" pop out allows you to load stars from GAIA or GSC2
catalogs; you must choose the catalog whose reference frame matches
your target catalog.  You can also load guide stars
from a file, change guide box size, or disable strict checking if absolutely 
necessary.  Click "Retrieve" to get a list of guide stars. The guide
stars will be plotted as blue points.  You have to scroll down in the
tab to see the list of guide stars after it was retrieved.

<p>

<h3>6. Generate Slits on objects</h3><p>

The "Generate Slits" pop out will assign slits to objects in your catalog.
You can let it vary the instrument PA freely, specify a range of PA to allow,
or fix it to the current value. You can also let it vary the mask center
position in RA and Dec.  You can choose the goal to optimize: most uniform
wavelength coverage, maximum slit packing, or fully random selection.
Click the "Place Slits" button to start the process. Once it has produced
slit assignments, it will populate the "Targets Assigned" table below the sky 
view. You have to scroll down in the Generate Slits tab to see this
"Targets Assigned" table. The selected targets and guide stars will now be colored cyan
points on the image.
<p>

Varying the PA: Binomask will take account of what PAs are observable
when your field is up and will avoid PAs that take your mask too close
to the rotator limits. So it's generally a good idea to let Binomask
optimize the PA. If you need to constrain the PA, it may complain
if the PAs are too close to the rotator limits.
<p>

Varying the mask center: Binomask can try a grid search of 5x5 centers
in RA/Dec over a range you specify (eg 2x2 arcmin) to optimize the
number of targets placed on slits. However, this slows down the slit
placing step by a
factor of 25 and currently may lead to timeout errors if you have a
large target catalog.
<p>

and Dec, and selected the maximum

Scrolled down to show the table of targets assigned to slits in the
second trial.
<p>

If you want to get a summary of how many objects in each priority were
assigned to slits, use your browser to copy/paste the target table
into a text file named e.g. "targetlist". Then run this unix command:
<pre>
  awk '{print $7}' targetlist | sort | uniq -c
</pre>
This should work if the copy/paste preserved rows so that the priority
is in column 7 of the text file.
<p>

<ul>
  <li>It would be useful to download the selected targets table as a csv or similar,
and this feature is slated for addition.

<li> It may be helpful to show the parallactic angle in this panel where we
can choose the PA range, although since there is an ADC (atmospheric dispersion compensator),
  the parallactic effect is mostly differential across the field rather
  than dispersing light out of each slit. We are working on how to visualize this.
</ul>
<p>

Slit widths are also set by the user. As an aid, the MMT web site
states that the median seeing is in the range of 0.77" - 0.85" based
on data from 2003 to the present. 1 arcsecond slits are a good
starting point.
<p>

You may get the error “slits can not be made” which often occurs
because the rotator setting is not correct. Try adding or subtracting
180 from the present setting.
<p>


Note that if you redesign a mask repeatedly and allow it to vary the
mask center each time, the center can wander away from the original
coordinates. To recenter it, go back to the Mask Configuration tab.
<p>

<h3>7. Submitting Your Mask</h3><p>

Finally, click the "Submit Mask" header to get a pop out that allows you to
submit the mask design.  You can also use this pop out to: make another mask
using unassigned targets from your catalog; clear and start over ; or to save
and load mask files to local disk. Note that you can save an unsubmitted 
mask, load it and submit, but you can't edit/change it before submission.
<p>

After submitting, you can choose to design more masks, or be sent back
to the MMT Queue Catalog page.
<p>

If you want to design multiple masks to tile a field or to overlap for 
greater coverage (eg second mask gets targets that could not be assigned on the first mask),
then you should make the first mask, submit it, and choose "Make Another."
This will send you back to the beginning. Choose your new mask center and 
go through the steps, and <it>keep the existing target catalog</it> rather than loading
it again. BinoMask keeps track of what objects have already been assigned, and
it will make the second mask using only objects that were not on the first mask
(and similarly if you make a third mask, etc). So you can design multiple masks
to cover a field, as long as you do them all in the same design session.
<p>

will show up on your queue management page.
<p>

<h3>8. Adding your mask as a target to the queue catalog</h3><p>

For each observation, you need to add it as a catalog target. This
will define the observing block(s) that are actually executed.
This is
done on your Queue Observing page. Choose "New Target" or 
"Add New" under the listing of Catalog Target Fields. For observation
type pick Mask, and then click
Already Submitted or Existing Mask and choose the name of the mask
that you made. The software will extract the RA/Dec from
the mask file for you. You then specify the grating and central wavelength,
and on the next dialog box you specify the exposure time, number of exposures,
and number of visits. For example you could ask for 2x1800 sec exposures x 4 visits
to get a total exp time of 4 hours, with the minimum visit always containing
a pair of exposures. This would be easier to schedule than asking for
8x1800 sec exposures in 1 visit.  (Need to clarify meaning of the "1 visit
per night" question.)
<p>

Note there is a distinction between "mask" and "target." A target is
basically an observing block definition. You could use
the same physical mask for more than one target. For example, you
might choose to observe the same mask at two different central
wavelength settings. Each would be a distinct "target" in the queue.
<p>

<h3> Notes </h3>
<p>

From the Queue Catalog page, if you click the name of a mask, it will
reopen BinoMask with fewer options. This will show a Mask
Configuration tab and a Save Mask tab. From Save Mask, you can click
Save Mask to File. This will download a file called mask.json (on
Safari it doesn't offer a choice of name/location, just instantly
downloads mask.json to my Downloads folder).  This is a text file
without any breaks - if you want to view it in a nice tree format, it
can be uploaded to an online JSON viewer, or parsed by standard JSON
parsing libraries.
<p>

Reopening / reusing older mask designs is under development, so some
aspects of that interface may change.
<p>

Note that
the differential atmospheric refraction across the 15 arcminute field
is significant, so that the location of slitlets depends on the hour
angle at which the mask is observed. In practice this means that the
mask machining would change slightly depending on whether the mask is
observed when HA is East or West. Thus the date and time of
observation specified during mask design are significant. Observable
hour angles will be taken into account during queue scheduling. 
<p>

<h3> Troubleshooting </h3>
<p>

<b> Can't access Binomask</b>:  Normally you start from your queue
catalog page and click "New Target" and "Launch Binomask." If this
takes you back to the scheduler homepage rather than starting
Binomask, the problem is a stale browser cookie that keeps track of
your login. We are working on fixing this. In the meantime, you can
fix it by either: 1. launching a private/incognito browser session and
accessing your catalog; or 2. clearing cookies in your browser for the hostname
"https://scheduler.mmto.arizona.edu"; the tokens to clear are "token"
and "PHPESSID".
<p>

<b>Load target catalog fails</b>: Check your catalog to make sure that
the field names in the header are exactly as shown here:
<tt>name,ra,dec,magnitude,priority,type</tt> and so on.
<p>

<b>Placing slits fails</b>: Check your catalog to make sure that
your priority column uses either all integer priorities, or all
floats. Mixing datatypes can cause an error.
<p>

<b>"Problem connecting to backend server" error during slit placement</b>: This means that the web
process is failing to talk to the server that is actually doing the
computation of allowable slit placement and optimization of number of
targets and priorities. It may happen if the computational load is
high or the slit placement is very demanding / takes a long
time. Large input target catalogs can cause this to happen. One option is to fix the mask center position: set the "Vary
Center By" RA and Dec numbers to 0 and place slits again. This speeds
up the computation by a factor of 25.
