<title>Using the MMT Queue Catalog</title>

<h1>The MMT Queue Catalog Interface</h1>
<p>

PIs of MMT programs that will be observed in the MMIRS or Binospec
 queues
manage their catalogs through a web interface. This page documents the interface.

<h2 id="access">Accessing your catalog</h2>
<p>

Each program has an email contact address, and the contact person will get an
email some time before the observing run, with a link to log in to the
catalog. Logging in takes you to a page that shows the deadlines for
slitmask submission and catalog submission before the run, typically
about 2 weeks and 1 week before the run starts.  You must check a box
acknowledging the instructions and submit this form to access the
catalog editor.

<b>The mask and catalog 
deadlines are important to get your masks made and targets verified
before the run starts.</b> If your mask designs are not in on time, the
masks cannot be machined and shipped to the MMT in time for the run
(and MMIRS masks must be loaded into the mask dewar before it is
cooled down). Even for imaging and longslit targets, your targets
must be added to the catalog by the target deadline before the run so
that the instrument scientist and queue observers can check for problems
and run queue scheduling software. PIs of ToO programs must contact
the MMT instrument scientist to discuss their catalog and the
procedures for triggering a ToO.
<p>

<h2 id="view">Catalog view</h2>
<p>


The middle of the catalog page shows a table of your targets. To create new entries
in the target table, use the new, copy, or upload buttons just above
the table. In the upper right of the window is
a list of masks that you have designed. There is a distinction between
"target" and "mask." A target defines an observation, so you can
have two targets that use the same mask, for example, short and 
long exposure times, or observations in two different semesters.
<p>

<p>

Below the catalog window is a summary of your requested time including
estimated overheads.  Overheads include wavefront sensing, acquisition
time, readout, and calibrations. The queue observers will typically
keep an accounting of the actual overhead time used during an observation.
<p> 

You must assign a priority 1, 2, or 3 to each observation. These help
us understand which observations are most important to you and
prioritize data taking. Please assign priorities so that roughly 1/3rd
of your time is in each category. If you have a small number of
targets, splitting in thirds may be difficult - just try to assign
priorities reasonably. We look at the overall completion percentage of a
program to split time fairly among programs, so assigning priority 1
to all of your programs won't get you more data, it just makes it
harder to tell which targets are most important (so don't do that).
<p>

<h3>Screenshot of the time allocation summary:</h3>

summary.
<p>

The columns of the target table are mostly self-explanatory. A few
useful icons include: clicking the location pin on the left will open a sky
visualization of the target; when data is taken, folder and box icons
appear in the Raw and Reduced columns for data download; and clicking
the clock icon on the extreme right brings up the history of the
observing block, including time of observation and observer's notes.
<p>

Above the target table is a gray bar labeled "MMTCATVIZ." Clicking
this will expand a sky visualization of the location of the
targets. To hide it, click the bar again.
<p>

<h2 id="mask">Designing a mask</h2>
<p>

To design a new mask, click the "New Target" button/text either in the
catalog panel or the mask list on upper right. This will open a new
target wizard (series of dialog boxes). Click "mask" and then "create
new mask." This should open mask design software for Binospec or
MMIRS. Descriptions of the mask designers are available separately for
<a href="binomask_info.html">BinoMask</a> and for MMIRS (link TBD).
When done designing the mask, you will return to the catalog page,
click "New Target" again, and choose "Already Submitted or Existing
Mask." This will load the parameters RA, Dec, PA from the mask design
file, and then let you choose exposure time, etc to create an entry in
the target table.
<p>

It's a good idea to give your mask a memorable name, after
your target, program, or PI, eg "ngc5894_v1_mask1" or "JSmith_field2",
etc. A unique ID number is appended to the mask name, but having masks
with generic names e.g. "Mask3" makes it harder to keep track. Also,
if you reuse masks in another semester you'll be glad for informative
names.
<p>

The queue catalog keeps track of masks that have been previously
designed by a PI, so when you make a target with "Already Submitted or
Existing Mask," you should get a list that allows you to choose masks that you designed in
previous semesters.  If you need to find a mask that is not in the
list, 
or if you need to use a mask designed by another person,
contact the MMT instrument scientists.
<p>

Often, designing slitmasks takes some trial and error, and you may
wind up designing a second version of your slitmasks. It helps to
add a "_v2" suffix or similar to the names. If you do this, it's not
currently possible to delete mask designs, but please contact your
MMT instrument scientist to request that the extra masks not be
machined.
<p>

<h2 id="target">Creating or modifying a target</h2>
<p>

To create a target, use the new, copy, or upload buttons. Clicking on an
existing target name lets you edit it. For a new target, the catalog
target wizard dialog boxes will appear, and prompt to choose one of
the three types of targets: imaging, longslit, or slitmask.
For a mask, you then choose from your designed masks, and the RA, Dec,
and PA are read from the mask file.  For imaging and longslit targets,
you fill in the RA, Dec, and PA.
<p>

You will fill in typical catalog
details: name, RA, Dec, and so on. Use an informative name that is
likely to be distinct from other targets in the queue: eg
"Virgo_dwarf_galaxy" is better than "Virgo1". The input boxes will
show help text if input is not in the correct format. Some notes on
input formats:
<p>

<ul>
  <li> RA and Dec must be in hh:mm:ss.s and dd:mm:ss.s.
  <li> Priority should be 1, 2, or 3.
  <li> Proper motions are not in mas/yr, but must be in PM_RA =
  seconds of time/century, and PM_Dec = seconds of are/century. These
  can be converted by:
  <pre>
pm_RA (sec of time/century) = pm_RA(mas/yr) / [10 * 15 * cos(Dec)]
pm_Dec (sec of arc/century) = pm_Dec(mas/yr) / 10
  </pre>
  <li> PA is degrees of East of North as usual. If you want
  parallactic angle, write that in the notes. However, the f/5
  instruments (Bino, MMIRS, Hecto) are behind an ADC, so the
  parallactic angle is not required.
  <li> Magnitude is for the queue observer's information, so they can
  determine whether the data quality is good.
  <li> Epoch is the time at which the RA/Dec coordinates are valid, e.g. 2015.5
  for Gaia DR2. This matters for high proper-motion objects, including
  some standard stars.
  <li> For information about filters, gratings, wavelengths, etc see
  the instrument webpages.
</ul>
<p>

The next dialog box sets the exposure time.  The total exposure on
your target will
be
<pre>
total = (exposure length) x (number of exposures) x (number of visits)
</pre>
For example, if you want six hours on a single Binospec mask, you
could enter 1200 sec exposures, 18 exposures, and 1 visit. For Binospec, 1200 sec is typically
the longest recommended exposure time due to cosmic rays.  The queue
software will break this up into 2-hour observing blocks for ease of
scheduling. If you absolutely need contiguous observations, e.g. for a
time sensitive observation such as a transit, put that and the time of
the event in your target notes.
<p>

The purpose of the "visit" is to indicate splitting your exposure, e.g. for
monitoring programs. So if you wanted to observe a target on six
nights for one hour each night, you would specify 6 visits and one
visit per night. For this or any other special constraint on observations,
please give instructions in the target notes.
<p>

Special observation instructions including time constraints,
weather/seeing constraints, requesting dithering, flux
standards, or twilight flats should also go in the target notes.
<p>

Clicking on a target name in the target table will bring up a dialog
box to edit the target parameters.  This box also allows you to delete
a target, if needed.
<p>
  
The target creation and edit windows allow you to specify offset stars
and to upload a finding chart image.  MMIRS can use offset stars. Please note that Binospec
doesn't use offset stars, but sets to your target directly; you must
have coordinates on the Gaia reference system (SDSS is close enough)
to accurately acquire the target.
