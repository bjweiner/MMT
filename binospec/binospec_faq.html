<h1>Binospec: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

Binospec is a multi-object wide field optical spectrograph for the
6.5-m MMT telescope, with two
rectangular 8x15 arcmin fields of view, each with its own
spectrograph.
It is run in a queue-observed mode.
For basic properties of Binospec see the <a
href="binospec_info.html">Binospec information page</a>.

<h2 id="general">General</h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3>

Binospec has a wide field of view and is very efficient across most of
the optical window (eg roughly 3600-9200 A).  It produces data with
a clean reduction free of most artifacts and sky subtraction
problems. A data delivery system and pipeline give quick access to raw
data=, and data can be reduced by users or by SAO staff. There is a
tool for measuring galaxy redshifts in reduced data.  What this adds
up to is that Binospec is good at getting sensitive spectra of largish
numbers of objects in fields of order 15 arcmin.
<p>

Binospec has acquisition and calibration overheads that add up to
nominally 30 minutes per spectroscopic target (often a bit less in
practice). This makes it less efficient at acquiring spectra of large
numbers of single bright objects needing eg 10-15 minute exposures, or
at survey tiling fields of a degree scale or more.
<p>

<h3>Overheads and observing block length</h3>

The queue catalog will assign each observing block a fiducial overhead,
currently set at 30 min for spectroscopy (either longslit or slit
mask) and 10 min for imaging.  This includes target acquisition,
instrument configuration, calibration exposures, and CCD readout
times. The actual overhead is often a little shorter for spectroscopy
(like 25 min) and we only charge programs the actual overhead. Some of
the overhead is due to night time calibrations (flats, arc lamp) that
take several minutes. Staff are exploring taking some calibrations
during the day to save time, but this will only knock off ~10 minutes
at most and could affect reduction quality.  What this means is that
taking a lot of spectra of objects that only need 10-15 minute
exposures is not an efficient use of Binospec time.
<p>

Additionally, the catalog software breaks requested observations into
observing blocks of at most 2 hours exposure time, for scheduling
practicality. This means that for example, if you assign a lot of
targets each 2.5 hours of exposure time, your program will look
inefficient. You could, for example, give some of them 2 hours and
some of them 3 hours, and lose less to overhead.
In practice, if we do manage to integrate for over 2 hours
consecutively on a target, your program would only be charged for one acquisition.
<p>


<h3>Guide and offset stars</h3>

You must supply accurate coordinates that are in the Gaia DR2
reference frame (SDSS is good enough).  Binospec's guide cameras can
then acquire guide stars with Gaia positions and set your target
directly onto the slit.  There is not currently a slit with a mirrored
surface, so it's not possible or necessary to use a slit viewing
camera to set the pointing on an offset star.  Just supply good
coordinates.
<p>

<h3>Common grating setups</h3>

The default setup for large wavelength coverage is the 270 lpmm
grating and central wavelength 6500 A.  If you need higher resolution,
the 1000 lpmm grating is better at the bluest wavelengths &lt; 5000 A,
and the 600 lpmm grating is better at redder wavelengths.  The central
wavelengths are continuously tunable but some values are not allowed,
see the table on the Binospec info page.
<p>

<h3>Longslit choice</h3>

The 1.0 arcsec wide slit is always in the instrument.  You should use
this unless you have a strong reason not to. It is well matched to the
typical seeing, and any other longslit has to be installed, which
means competing for space with all the slitmasks in a given queue (ie
your program could only be observed on nights when your longslit is
in).
<p>

<h3>Spectroscopic exposure lengths</h3>

We strongly recommend a maximum of 20 minutes per single exposure due
to build up of cosmic rays.  We also recommend to get at least 3
exposures per target to remove cosmic rays; the pipeline will run more
easily and data will be better.
<p>

Exposures shorter than 60 sec or so are inefficient due to readout and
only recommended for bright objects like standard stars.  If you are
doing a long time series like a planetary transit, 120 sec has been
used in the past.
<p>

<h3>Blue blocking filters</h3>

Binospec has two spectroscopic blocking filters, LP3500 and LP3800.  These are long-pass,
blocking blue light. They have about 98-99% throughput longward of
3500 A and 3800 A respectively. They prevent 2nd order blue light from
contaminating the 1st order spectrum, which can be a problem
especially for
intrinsically blue objects.  Generally, you should use LP3800 unless
you are observing the 3500-3800 A range.
<p>

<h3>Parallactic angle</h3>

Binospec is behind an ADC (atmospheric dispersion compensator), so you
don't need to observe at the parallactic angle, although the observers
will sometimes set the longslit at an angle that tracks through parallactic
anyway.
<p>

<h3>Same mask with different gratings or central wavelengths</h3>

You can use the same multislit mask with two different wavelenth
tunings. This is a common way to get large wavelength coverage at
moderately high resolution with the 600 line grating, for example (of
course it takes twice as much time, but you also resolve the sky
better).  It's also possible to observe the same mask
with two gratings, eg the 1000 and 600 lpmm gratings.
<p>

<h3>Using a previously designed mask</h3>

Currently we are storing all the previously designed masks, so if you
want to observe a mask from a previous semester, that's possible. The
queue catalog will let you select one of your previous masks. You
should also be able to find masks designed by one of your Co-Is. If
you have any problems finding an existing mask, contact your MMT
instrument scientist.
<p>

<h3>Spectrophotometric standards</h3>

If you need standards for flux calibration or telluric correction, put
a note in the comments field of your object.  If you're especially
concerned about tellurics you may want to note that so we know to take
the standard reasonably close.  You can add standard stars to your
catalog; put them in as priority 3 so the queue scheduler doesn't try
to schedule them as normal observations. You <b>must update standard
coordinates to the current epoch using Gaia</b>. Many standard stars
are white dwarfs with high proper motions, and many popular lists of
standards are horribly out of date.  For more information see the <a
href="http://mingus.mmto.arizona.edu/~bjw/mmt/spectro_standards.html">MMT
spectro standards page<a>.
<p>

<h3>Pseudo-IFU mode</h3>

It's possible to build up an integral-field-like spatially resolved
spectrum by taking a series of exposures stepping the longslit (or
slitmask) in the perpendicular to slit direction.  This step is
controlled by the observer in instrument coordinates, so you need to
specify the step size across the slit, not in compass directions.
For example, say "use PA=45 and step by 2 arcsec perpendicular to the
slit, doing 5 positions at -4, -2, 0, +2, +4 arcsec." Don't say
"use PA=45 and do 5 positions stepping by 2.8 arcsec north."
<p>

<h3>Afternoon "sky" flats for spectroscopy</h3>

Sky flats aren't part of the normal Binospec reduction
process. However, some programs that need very good knowledge of the
instrumental profile can benefit from afternoon spectroscopic flats
using the solar spectrum. These are used to measure the instrumental
profile by comparison with model spectra. You probably don't need
these unless you are measuring velocity dispersions or doing precision
radial velocity work. They are time-consuming to take and require
coordination between TO and queue observer, so please contact your MMT
instrument scientist if you think you might need them.
<p>

<h3>Avoiding rotator limits for slitmasks</h3>

The instrument rotator has limits near +180/-180 degrees.  These
can prevent observing slitmasks at certain PAs and certain times.
In practice, the limits mean that to avoid hitting the limit at
transit,
for masks that are north of the MMT
(Dec &gt; +33), you should avoid designing masks with position angles near 0, and for masks
south of the MMT (Dec &lt; +33), you should avoid PAs near +180 or
-180.
<p>

<h2 id="imaging">Imaging</</h2>

<h3>Imaging exposure lengths</h3>

Individual direct imaging exposures should be kept pretty short, especially if you are
working in a field with a lot of stars (lower Galactic latitude) or
near the peak of detector sensitivity (r or i band).  If so, direct
imaging exposures should be no more than 60 seconds, or you will
saturate a lot of stars.  Probably in
all fields and filters, imaging exposures should be less than about
240-300 seconds. Saturated stars cause persistence problems that can
damage data on faint targets taken after your field.
<p>

<h3>Imaging flatfields</h3>

Flatfields for imaging are taken in the afternoon
with an internal lamp, and we have to
use one of the arc comparison lamps because the spectroscopic continuum lamp is
too bright.  This means that imaging flatfields will show up in your
raw data package with image type 'comp'. Flatfields can be shared
between targets, so you might get a notification about data being
available for a target when only the afternoon flats have been 
<p>

<h3>Imaging dithers</h3>

It's not currently possible to make really large dithers while imaging
because the guide stars would go off the subarray (region of interest)
of the guide cameras.  The detectors are pretty clean so modest
dithers should take care of most detector artifacts.
<p>

<h2 id="data">Data products</h2>

<h3>Raw and reduced data</h3>

Raw data will typically show up in your catalog the next morning,
copied over around 9 am MST. These include *.fits and *proc.fits files
- the proc files have been overscan and bias subtracted and trimmed.
Spectroscopic data can be reduced by the Binospec IDL pipeline. SAO staff
will reduce the data when time is available.  The data package also
includes a file with an auto-generated reduction script, so you can
download the pipeline and try reducing the raw data yourself. Several
of our users have reduced the longslit data with the conventional IRAF
cookbook workflow (Massey et al) that they've used for other longslit
instruments.
The Binospec
pipeline doesn't reduce imaging data, but you can reduce those with
IRAF or any other typical method for reducing imaging.
<p>

<h3>How do I look at the data?</h3>

The reduced data files include an image that has 1-d spectra, one per
row, and a file with many extensions, each the 2-d spectrum of one
slit.  See a description at the <a
href="https://bitbucket.org/chil_sai/binospec/wiki/Home">Binospec
pipeline repository wiki</a>. To inspect spectra and fit redshifts, you can try the Specpro
software in the version adapted for Binospec, see the <a href="bino_specpro_hints.html">Using Specpro to inspect
Binospec data</a> page.
<p>


<h3>Where's my longslit object?</h3>

The longslit masks have a slit on each of Side A and Side B, and the
data are stored in extensions 1 and 2 of a fits file. Your object is
in one side, and the other slit is on some random part of sky about 10
arcmin away. Typically longslit targets are observed on side B.
So if you don't see the object's trace, look in the second
extension of the FITS file.
<p>

<h2 id="other">Other topics</h2>

<h3>Non-sidereal targets</h3>

The MMT can track non-sidereal targets that have a JPL ephemeris. We
should be able to acquire and track a solar system object for imaging by
offsetting the telescope to put the object into one of the two
Binospec fields.  Testing on this is in progress.  We recommend that
you contact MMT staff so we can set up a conference call between PI,
instrument scientist and queue observers before such an observation.
<p>

Taking spectra of a non-sidereal target will be more involved since
acquiring it onto the slit will not use the RA/Dec and Gaia stars. If
you plan to do such an observation, please get in touch with MMT staff
so we can coordinate with the Binospec instrument team.
