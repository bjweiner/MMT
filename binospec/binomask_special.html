<h1>Binospec and BinoMask special techniques</h1>
<p>


This page covers some special or black-belt issues for Binospec and
the BinoMask slitmask design software.
<p>

<ul>
  <li>Large catalogs of input objects
  <li>Variable slit lengths
  <li>Querying GAIA for guide stars
</ul>
<p>

<h2 id="largecat">Large catalogs of input objects</h2>
<p>

If you have a lot of targets, for example if you have a primary sample
and a large catalog of 100s-1000s of lower-priority filler targets, slitmask design
becomes more difficult. Two problems are: (1) it's hard to see where
your primary targets are in the js9 sky view; (2) with many targets,
optimizing the mask placement over RA/Dec and PA can take a long time
and time out, giving you a "Problem connecting to backend server"
error and failure to place slits.
<p>

A method for dealing with this is to make two catalogs: the first
contains your primary targets only, and the second contains your
primary and filler targets.  (Thanks to Christopher Willmer for
suggesting this method.) Begin designing the slitmask with only
the primary targets, and in Generate Slits,
vary the PA and mask center to optimize the
mask placement.  Then record the mask RA, Dec, and PA, but don't
submit the mask. Go back to the Target List tab and select the full
catalog with filler targets.  (It should retain the optimized
mask RA, Dec, and PA, but it is wise to record them to be sure.)
Now go back to Generate Slits and keep the RA, Dec, and PA fixed at
the previous values. This will place slits, including the optimized
primary targets, and add filler targets as available.
<p>

<h2 id="slitlength">Variable slit lengths</h2>
<p>

Currently, BinoMask only allows you to select a global minimum slit
length (6 arcsec is recommended). It will extend slits that don't
collide with other objects, but you cannot specify that object 1 needs
a 60 arcsec slit while objects 2 through 1000 can use 6 arcsec slits,
(eg a large central galaxy and small satellites), or that two classes
of objects need different lengths.
<p>

It is possible to make different slit lengths by designing a mask with
the usual short slit lengths, and then hand editing the JSON
file that is produced by Binomask to lengthen somme of them. Design
the mask, and at the end, before submitting, save the mask to a file - this
should download a file called mask.json. This is a text file with data
structures, and is easiest to read in a JSON viewer/editor - there are
many online, for example <a
href="https://jsoneditoronline.org/">https://jsoneditoronline.org/</a>.
<p>

You will need to find the structure of the slit of the object that you
want to lengthen. The slits are numbered within the "sidea" and
"sideb" structures, and each slit structure contains RA, Dec, and
object id, along with many other numbers. The field "polygon" in the
slit structure has 8 numbers (4 X,Y pairs) that specify the slit
corners in mm, <i>not in arcsec</i>. X is the dispersion direction and
Y is the direction along the slit; you want to edit the Y-numbers,
which are indexes 1,3,5,7 (0-based). The plate scale of the 6.5-m f/5
MMT is 0.16 mm/arcsec. After you lengthen a slit, you must <i>remove
the slits that would overlap with it in the Y-direction</i>, by
deleting their data structures from the JSON file. The standard
spacing between slits in the Y-direction is 1.5 arcsec (0.24 mm), so
leave that margin between your new slit and the remaining slits.
<p>

Clearly, this is a black-belt technique that risks creating a bad mask
specification or overlapping slits, so leave yourself plenty of time
to work on it. You may be able to load the modified json file back into
Binomask to visualize it.  You may not be able to submit the modified file
in the normal way; if so, email the JSON file to Sean Moran and Ben
Weiner.
<p>

<h2 id="guidestars">Querying GAIA for guide stars</h2>
<p>

Normally, Binomask will simply query a server at the CDS for guide
stars from GAIA and you won't have to worry about it. However, we have
had an issue where the CDS server was down, and no guide stars were
retrieved. If this happens, you can query the GAIA catalog from a
mirror of Vizier, such as the CADC mirror.  You want stars that are
roughly between Gmag 11 and 18 - bright stars for wavefront, and guide
stars of mag 16-18. You need to make a CSV file that has <tt>name, ra,
dec, magnitude, pm-ra, pm-dec, epoch</tt>. Rough instructions follow.
<p>

Visit the <a href="http://vizier.hia.nrc.ca/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=I/345">GAIA
DR2 Vizier at CADC</a>.
<ul>
  <li>Enter your field coordinates and a 30 arcmin
search radius.
  <li>click "gaia2" in the Tables window at left.
  <li>In the Preferences box at left, select max rows 99999, and try ";
separated values" for the output format.
  <li>In the long list of catalog quantities towards the bottom of the
  page, click the ALL cols checkbox at left twice to uncheck
  everything, then check only the params
RA_ICRS, DE_ICRS, Source, Epoch, pmRA, pmDE, Gmag.
  <li>Enter "11 .. 18" in the Gmag constraint box to return only stars
  with 11 &lt; Gmag &lt; 18.
  <li>click the Submit button.
</ul>
<p>

This should download a .tsv file with perhaps several hundred
stars. It has a long header, a footer, a header line of
"RA_ICRS;DE_ICRS;Source;Epoch;pmRA;pmDE;Gmag", a line of dashes, and
the data. Make a .csv file with a single comma-separated header line
by editing the file:
<ul>
  <li>delete the header and footer,
  <li>change the single header line to
  "ra,dec,name,epoch,pm-ra,pm-dec,magnitude",
  <li>delete the line of dashes,
  <li>and change all the semicolon separators to commas.
  </ul>
This should make a file that you can upload to Binomask in the guide stars
tab.  I don't think the column order matters as long as you get the
  header names in the correct order to match the data.
