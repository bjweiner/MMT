<h1>MMT/Binospec: preliminary information
</h1>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/mmti/binospec.html">Binospec
spectrograph</a> has been commissioned at the MMT telescope in fall 2017. Binospec
is a multislit imaging spectrograph with two 8' x 15' fields of view,
wide wavelength coverage, and high efficiency.
There are two identical all-refractive spectrographs, one for each
field. Each channel has several gratings and filters.  
<p>

This page provides preliminary information about Binospec for potential 
users and proposers. Binospec was successfully commissioned in fall
2017 and is scheduled for shared-risk science
observing in spring 2018.

<h3 id="basics">Binospec overview: basics</h3>

Binospec is installed at the f/5 Cassegrain focus of the MMT. It 
has two fields of view that are 8' x 15' with a 
gap of 3.2'. Two sheet metal slit masks held in a machined frame cover
the fields of view. Each slit mask can hold over 150 slitlets,
parallel to the long side of the masks. Each spectrograph has 3 gratings and 4 <i>griz</i> filters, and a 4K x 4K CCD detector. 
Two guiders and a wavefront sensor are used for guiding and image
control.  Guiding and alignment are done through stars 
viewed through holes at each end of the slit mask.   
The spectrographs have active flexure compensation by moving
the CCDs.
<p>

Each side has a 4K x 4K deep depleted E2V CCD detector with 15 micron pixels and a scale of
0.24 arcsec/pixel.  The resolution per pixel is tabulated below. The wavelength coverage of a slitlet depends on
the distance from slitlet to optical axis along the X direction (along
the short side of the masks).  From near (central) side of the mask to
the far side,
the change in coverage is approximately 900 A to the blue for the 600
gpm grating.
<p>

Slitmasks will be machined by a laser cutter at the MMT. Slitmasks
will be configured by software written at SAO and running on a server
hosted at the MMT. Users will log into a web interface to
interactively design masks and submit them. Masks must be configured
ahead of time to allow time for machining. Masks with long slits are also
provided; the widths available are 0.75", 1.0", 1.25", 1.5", and 5".
One long-slit mask will always be loaded, typically the 1.0". If
different long-slit widths are needed, please
request these widths in your target catalog submission so they can be
loaded ahead of time. 10 slitmasks can be loaded
simultaneously. Masks can be changed during the daytime (and
potentially during the night pending approval of this mode and
training of staff).
<p>

<h3 id="spectral">Spectral properties</h3>

Binospec has 3 gratings for each spectrograph. The grating
resolution, approximate simultaneous wavelength coverage, and other properties including blaze, anamorphic demagnification,
and pixel scale are given in
this table for the 270, 600, and 1000 lines/mm gratings.  The 600 line
grating is shown at three different tilts. 
The wavelengths used for the flexure control system limit the usable central wavelength settings to those given in the second table.
The pixel scale along the slit is the normal 0.24 arcsec/pixel; due to anamorphic demagnification, the pixels per slit in the spectral direction are larger, so a 1 arcsec slit projects onto approx 3.2-3.7 pixels depending on the grating and tilt. The resolution listed is a FWHM (R = lambda/dlambda).

<h3 id="sensitivity">Sensitivity / exposure times</h3>

<p>
Binospec is expected to be several times more efficient than Hectospec
due to throughput and improved sky subtraction.
Here are on-sky throughput measurements made with the three gratings
during commissioning, which should be taken as lower limits as the sky was not completely photometric. Three central wavelength settings are included for the 600gpm grating. 
<p>

<!--
This plot shows the
calculated throughput as a function of wavelength for the 600 lines/mm
grating. It will be updated when there are on-sky measurements from
commissioning.
<p>

<img src="bino_600lpm_expected_throughput.png" alt="Expected throughput plot">

<h3 id="etc">Exposure time calculator</h3>

<p>
SAO has built an exposure time / sensitivity calculator for Binospec
and Hectospec.  A preliminary version is available at this link:
<a href="http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/ETC.html">
<b>Binospec exposure time calculator</b> </a>, which also gives you an
option to download the package.
<p>

A direct link to the spectroscopic exposure time calculator for
spectra is:
<a

.

<h3 id="configuration">Binospec configuration</h3>

A model of the optical train of Binospec is shown below, illustrating
the single slitmask at the top, and the paired spectrographs, filters,
gratings, and detectors.

<p>

The paired fields of view on the sky are shown below in green - the
separation between them is 3.2 arcmin.  The yellow boxes are the
guider patrol regions, and the blue box is the wavefront sensor
patrol region.
The slitmasks cover the guider regions
and holes are machined into into the masks at the location of guide
stars, to allow for slitmask alignment and guiding.

<p>



<h3 id="observing">Observing procedures</h3>

<p>
Binospec observations will be done in a queue, similar to Hectospec
and MMIRS.  The queue will be administered by MMT staff and the
instrument will usually be operated by MMT queue observers. PIs/guest
observers will typically not come to the telescope.  PIs will submit
observing catalogs and mask designs through the  <a
href="http://scheduler.mmto.arizona.edu/">MMT queue scheduling
interface</a>. Prior to the run, PIs will get an email asking them to
log in to the queue scheduler to upload catalogs and observation details.
<p>

Binospec can hold 10 slitmasks, and these can be changed out freely
during the day (unlike MMIRS), and potentially at nght.
However, there is a lead time for
machining masks.
<p>

The grating tilt controls wavelength coverage.
We anticipate that a limited number of standard grating tilts will
usually/initially be used, to ease calibration requirements and configuration
changes during the night.
The instrument can be changed from spectroscopic to imaging mode
quickly, and will have <i>g, r, i, z</i> filters for each side. We do
not anticipate initially offering mixed observing between the sides
(ie imaging + spectra, or two different gratings).
<p>


<h3 id="acquisition">Target acquisition and coordinates</h3>

<p>
Binospec uses guiders offset from the main field of view, patrolling
the yellow box regions in the figure above. Guide stars can be
selected automatically from GAIA (preferred) or GSC2 catalogs. Thus,
<b>it is necessary to supply coordinates that are on the GAIA or GSC2
system. The correct coordinate system is critically important for both
longslit and slitmask spectroscopy</b>.
<p>

Targets for longslit spectroscopy will be offset onto the slit by
acquiring
stars onto the guiders, whose positions have been calibrated relative
to the slit.  Thus, your target position needs to be on the same
system as the guide stars. The pointing can be tuned up by tilting the
grating to zeroth order and taking a direct image of the target
through the slit.  This should work for objects brighter than some
magnitude (R~21). For faint targets, PIs should provide a nearby
offset star on the same coordinate system as the target. <b>Offset star
coordinates and any other useful information about the target can be
entered in the "notes" section of your observing catalog.</b>
<p>

Acquiring using a slit-viewing camera requires a "mirrored" slit mask
whose use has not yet been commissioned, so good coordinates that
allow the above procedure to work are a requirement.
<p>

For multi-slit masks, the PI will provide a list of targets on GAIA or
GSC2 coordinate systems. The BinoMask slitmask design program will add
suitable guide stars and cut alignment holes in the slitmask, through
which the guiders will image the stars and tune up the alignment of
the mask.
<p>

<h3 id="slitmask">Slitmask design</h3>

<p>
Slitmask design will be done by PIs using the BinoMask web based interface.
Masks will be machined with a laser cutter on
the mountain by SAO staff. Masks will need to be submitted well in
advance of the start of queue observations for a semester.
<p>

Please see the <a href="binomask_info.html">BinoMask slitmask design
interface tutorial</a> webpage for a more detailed walkthrough of using the
software.
<p>

You will be running a web-based mask making program called <b>BinoMask</b> which
will take a text file as input, containing your targets to be
observed.  If your objects are on the GAIA coordinate system, binomask
can add guide and wavefront-sensor stars for you.  If not, you must create a second
catalog with such stars on the same coordinate system as your targets,
extending to at least 0.4 degree in radius from the center of your
target field. For guide stars, please select a magnitude range of
r=14-18; for WFS stars, magnitude r=11-14.
<p>

The format for the catalogs is an ASCII file with columns. You may separate entries either with a comma or a tab. The first line of the file is a header:
<pre>name, ra, dec, magnitude, priority, pm-ra, pm-dec, epoch, type</pre>
The following lines contain entries for those columns.
<p>

Only ra and dec are required, but name, magnitude, & priority are also recommended. (1=highest priority, then 2, 3, etc). Coordinates may be in decimal degrees or sexagesimal.  Type should be 1 (or “target”), 2 (“sky”) or 3 (“standard”).
<p>

A queue scheduling interface similar to the MMIRS user interface allows PIs to
submit mask designs and track their program progress.
The materials/machining cost for slitmasks will be determined at a later date.
<p>

Mask making is integrated with telescope scheduling software. Thus if
you have been granted time, you will receive an email from
scheduler@mmto.org with instructions to log in, make masks, and submit
catalogs. You may also use
the mask making software outside of that framework. To run the BinoMask
software visit <a
href="http://scheduler.mmto.arizona.edu/BinoMask/">scheduler.mmto.arizona.edu/BinoMask/</a>.

Slit widths are also set by the user. As an aid, the MMT web site
states that the median seeing is in the range of 0.77" - 0.85" based
on data from 2003 to the present. 1 arcsecond slits are a good
starting point.
<p>

Note that
the differential atmospheric refraction across the 15 arcminute field
is significant, so that the location of slitlets depends on the hour
angle at which the mask is observed. In practice this means that the
mask machining would change slightly depending on whether the mask is
observed when HA is East or West. Thus the date and time of
observation specified during mask design are significant. Observable
hour angles will be taken into account during queue scheduling. 
<p>

You may get the error “slits can not be made” which often occurs
because the rotator setting is not correct. Try adding or subtracting
180 from the present setting.
<p>

<h3 id="queue">Queue scheduling</h3>

<p>
In order to obtain the maximum scientific impact from Binospec, we
will to continue the queue scheduling that has proven successful with
Hectospec, Hectochelle and MMIRS.  Queue scheduling offers the
considerable advantage that we can flexibly adapt the observing
program to the current conditions.  We will reserve conditions of
perfect transparency and superb seeing for those projects that can
take best advantage of excellent conditions.   Queue scheduling also
allows observations to be obtained at low air-mass and allows
continuous observation of high priority objects.  The instrumeht will
be operated by MMT staff queue observers, and proposers are not
generally expected to travel to the telescope.
<p>


<h3 id="data">Data reduction</h3>

<p>
Binospec will have a data pipeline, written in IDL by SAO staff and
publicly available, that is similar to the <a
href="http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/mmirs_pipeline.html">MMIRS
pipeline</a>.  The SAO TDC is anticipated to return reduced data to
the PIs. The timescale for data reduction is TBD.  Availability of
quick look reductions or quickly returning raw and reduced data are
recognized as desirable for some programs and will be addressed. A
quicklook for queue observers to assess data quality is in progress.
<p>

The raw data are stored as multiextension fits files; each CCD has 4
amplifiers, each of which is stored as an extension. Data taken are
archived at the CfA. A pipeline under development (in late 2017) will
be used to process the data and provide wavelength calibrated,
relative-flux corrected spectra.
In progress: the archive data system will send you a notification the day after any of your
data is taken, at which time you may download the raw data. A few days
later, you will receive another message concerning the reduced data.
We are also developing an addition to the MMT queue catalog management
pages that will allow you to view available data files and download
them from your catalog page.
